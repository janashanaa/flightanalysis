In this project I will be analysing a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction) that's derived from a _flight booking website_.<br>

## Tasks:
1. Data cleaning using Python
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
3. Data visualisation using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Key Questions:
- What's the most popular airline in this dataset?
- What's the average price of each airline?
- What time of day do most flights depart and arrive and vice versa?
- Does ticket price vary with change in departure and arrival periods?
- What cities do most flights depart from and arrive to and vice versa?
- Does ticket price vary with change in source and destination cities?
- Is there a relationship between booking date and the price you pay?
- What is the trend of price changes as the departure day approaches?
